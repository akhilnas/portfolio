## Akhil Nasser - Full Stack Data Scientist based in Frankfurt

**Greetings!** I'm Akhil Nasser, a Full stack Data Scientist residing in the bustling Financial capital of Germany - [Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt). With a keen eye for details and a love for solving challenging problems, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to the world of data science.

## Skills and Expertise

My primary area of focus for the last two years has been in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLM). I utilize a vaiety of techniques drawn from Machine learning, deep learning or reinforcement learning librarires. I have experimented with time-series analysis and recommender systems during my free-time.

I do not put an undue emphasis on the branch of the artifial intelligence tree the particular method belongs to but rather how good and efficient it is to solve the current problem in question.

I also list out my technical skills using the following categories which are sorted based on how often I have used them.

**Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, Julia, C/C++, J

**Cloud Platform Services:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) - EC2, Sagemaker, Lambda, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, Google Colab, Databricks

I addition to these skills I am also a frequent user of Git and Excel, an occassional user of Tableau.

My native language is Malayalam although I am native-level fluent in English having studied it throughout my schooling years. My German is at the A2 level.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I excel at tackling complex challenges and turning concepts into practical, effective solutions and products. Whether it's optimizing performance, implementing new features/functionality, or troubleshooting issues, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.

## Continuous Learning

The dynamic nature of the tech industry inspires me to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements. I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace emerging technologies that reveal new solution pathways or inform us of new workflows for use in data science projects.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication. Whether working with stakeholders or team members, I value clear communication to ensure the success of every project.
